The package provides functions related to finding the spacegroup of a crystal. (The spacegroup of a crystal is useful in the context density functional theory calculations, computational materials science, and machine learning for materials prediction.)

This package will eventually provide all of the functionality of the [enumlib package](https://github.com/msg-byu/enumlib) and some additional functionality, useful for machine learning applications and materials science. In this pre-release version, only a pointgroup finder is provided.

One of the unique features of the package is its robustness to finite-precision issues, a constant bane of other spacegroup codes.

A few simple examples are provided below. This package finds spacegroup symmetries very efficiently by making the assumption that the basis is as compact as possible. To do this, it reduces the input basis vectors to a "Minkowski-reduced" basis. (See [MinkowskiReduce.jl](https://github.com/glwhart/MinkowskiReduction.jl))


## Example 1: Hexagonal lattice
```
julia> u,v,w = ([1, 0, 0], [0.5, √3/2, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, √(8/3)])
([1, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.8660254037844386, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.632993161855452])

julia> pointGroup(u,v,w)
24-element Vector{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [-1 0 0; -1 1 0; 0 0 -1]
...
 [1 0 0; 1 -1 0; 0 0 1]
```

By default the output is is "direct coordinates", the transformation matrices showing integer combinations of the basis that yield equivalent, but rotated basis vectors.  

## Example 2: Rhombohedral lattice, arbitrary rotation of coordinate system

```
 julia> u = [1, 1, 2]; v = [1, 2, 1];  w = [2, 1, 1];

julia> u, v, w = threeDrotation(u, v, w, π / 3, π / 5, π / 7)
([1.0328466951537383, 1.855345731770484, 1.2210323173082058], [-0.2604424479658839, 2.2850084410500355, 0.8431525103014423], [0.7968127453125833, 2.3142904165695555, -0.09565206052008146])

julia> length(pointGroup(u, v, w)) == 12
true

julia> pointGroup(u, v, w)
