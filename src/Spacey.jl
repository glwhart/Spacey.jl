""" pointgroup_robust(a1, a2, a3)

Calculate the pointGroup using an epsilon based on input lattice 

The routine works in a similar fashion to the pointGroup_fast routine but
finite precision comparisons use an epsilon scaled to the input. The 
epsilon is quite large, 10% (may change) of the smallest scale of the 
input. With sufficient testing, this routine may become the defacto standard
for the Spacey package.
